## Overview
The code contained in this repository was my responsibility, but fits within and cooperates with a larger code base discussed below in [Context](https://github.com/JacobWPeterson/ProductViewer#Context).

An existing API served all of the data needed for the online storefront, but from there everything from server, to client-side, to final design was up to me. One constraint on the project was that we could not rely on external NPM modules or libraries to impement elements, such as an image carousel or infinite scroll.

## Context
This is part of a larger project that can be found [here](https://github.com/Pivitol-Penguins/PPFEC). The larger project included a questions and answers section and a reviews and ratings section. Our team divided these responsibilities as follows, with the file paths corresponding to the team repository.
