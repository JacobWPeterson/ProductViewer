## Overview
For our front-end capstone project at Hack Reactor our team was tasked with building a product page for a ficticious store. An API had been created that contained all of the data we would need, but from there everything from server, to client-side, to final design was up to us. One constraint on the project was that we could not rely on external NPM modules or libraries to impement elements, such as an image carousel or infinite scroll.

Our team divided responsibilities as follows:
